# CypherFaucet

A small, focused dev-net faucet. Developers enter a testnet/stagenet address,
complete a captcha, and receive a fixed payout on a rate limit. It serves
Monero (**stagenet** and **testnet**) and Litecoin (**testnet**), runs at
[cypherfaucet.com](https://cypherfaucet.com), and is listed on getmonero.org.

Two engines share one database, design, and rate-limit logic, with the active
network chosen by the URL via `.htaccess`:

- [xmr-faucet.php](xmr-faucet.php) for Monero, both nets selected by `?net=`.
- [core-faucet.php](core-faucet.php) for Bitcoin Core-family coins, selected by
  `?coin=` (Litecoin testnet today; Bitcoin testnet ready behind one config
  entry, no new code).

## Features

- Two engines, one shared DB, style, and rate-limit design:
  - **Monero** ([xmr-faucet.php](xmr-faucet.php)): stagenet and testnet in one
    file, gated on the wallet's **unlocked** balance so it never offers a claim
    it can't pay (Monero locks outputs for 10 blocks), with **payment proof**
    on each receipt (a `get_tx_proof` signature that verifies in the Monero
    GUI's Prove/Check or CLI) for when the dev-net explorers are down.
  - **Bitcoin Core-family** ([core-faucet.php](core-faucet.php)): Litecoin
    testnet today (tLTC), Bitcoin testnet ready behind one config entry. Talks
    to a Bitcoin Core JSON-RPC and links each receipt's txid to a block
    explorer.
- Each coin/net defined as a config map entry, not duplicated code.
- Cloudflare Turnstile captcha.
- Per-address and per-IP rate limiting, serialized with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so
  concurrent requests can't double-claim.
- Live wallet/daemon **sync status** and **lifetime** stats (total sent /
  payouts / last payout), kept in a counter table that survives data pruning.
- IP retention sweep (cron) so claimer IPs are not kept indefinitely.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+ with `pdo_sqlite` and `curl`.
- Apache with `mod_rewrite` (and `mod_headers` for the security headers). The
  routing lives in [.htaccess](.htaccess); nginx users must translate it.
- For Monero: a `monerod` + `monero-wallet-rpc` instance **per net** (stagenet
  and testnet), bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- For Litecoin: a `litecoind` on testnet (`-testnet`) with `server=1` and its
  RPC bound to `127.0.0.1` (default port `19332`), holding spendable tLTC.
- SQLite 3.24+ (for the `ON CONFLICT` upsert used by the stats counter).

## Setup

1. **Config.** Copy the example and fill it in:
   ```sh
   cp config.example.php config.php
   ```
   Set your Turnstile sitekey/secret, the Monero wallet RPC credentials (or
   leave blank if the wallet uses `--disable-rpc-login` on localhost), the
   Litecoin `ltc_rpc_user` / `ltc_rpc_pass`, and your public `source_url`.
   `config.php` is gitignored; never commit it.

2. **Database.** Create the SQLite file and tables:
   ```sh
   cd db && python3 create_db.py
   ```
   For production, keep the DB **outside the web root** and point the app at it:
   ```sh
   export FAUCET_DB=/var/lib/cypherfaucet/faucet.db
   ```
   (Set it in your vhost / PHP-FPM pool env.) If unset, it defaults to
   `db/faucet.db`. Whichever directory holds the DB must be writable by the web
   server user, because SQLite writes a journal there.

3. **Wallets and daemons.**
   - **Monero:** run `monero-wallet-rpc` for each net on the expected ports
     (stagenet `38088`, testnet `28088`) and the matching `monerod` daemons
     (`38081` / `28081`, used only for the sync-status line). Adjust ports or
     set `daemon_url` per net in the `$FAUCETS` map in
     [xmr-faucet.php](xmr-faucet.php) if your setup differs.
   - **Litecoin:** run `litecoind -testnet` with `server=1` and
     `rpcuser` / `rpcpassword` matching `config.php`, RPC bound to `127.0.0.1`
     (port `19332`). Ports and the explorer link live in the `$COINS` map in
     [core-faucet.php](core-faucet.php).

4. **Web server.** Serve the directory with Apache + `mod_rewrite`. The
   `.htaccess` maps `/xmr-stagenet`, `/xmr-testnet`, and `/ltc-testnet` to the
   apps and denies web access to `db/`.

5. **Retention cron.** Prune old claim rows (PII) daily:
   ```cron
   17 4 * * * FAUCET_DB=/var/lib/cypherfaucet/faucet.db php /path/to/db/cleanup.php >> /var/log/cypherfaucet-cleanup.log 2>&1
   ```
   Run it as a user that can write the DB and its directory.

## Operating the faucet

Monero locks every output for **10 blocks (~20 min)**, including the change that
comes back from each payout. If the wallet holds one large output, the first
payout locks the rest and claims stall until it unlocks.

Fund the wallet with **many small outputs** (for example ~0.015 each, covering a
0.01 payout plus fee headroom), batch-sent from your collection/donation
address. That keeps a pool of independently spendable outputs ahead of the lock.
The app gates on the unlocked balance, so if the pool is ever exhausted it shows
a "coins locking, try again shortly" message instead of failing a claim.

[`tools/fund_faucet.py`](tools/fund_faucet.py) automates this. Run it on the
machine holding the donation wallet (pointed at that wallet's
`monero-wallet-rpc`), sending to the faucet wallet's receiving address. It
batches the outputs into as few transactions as possible to save fees:

```sh
python3 tools/fund_faucet.py \
    --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:38083/json_rpc \
    --address <faucet stagenet address> \
    --nettype stagenet \
    --count 50            # 50 outputs of 0.015; add --dry-run to preview
```

It validates the address against the chosen net and checks the donation
wallet's unlocked balance before sending. Stdlib only, no dependencies.

### Automated top-up

For hands-off operation, run it in `--target` mode on a timer. It reads the
faucet wallet's balance and sends only the shortfall, doing nothing when the
faucet is already funded, so it's safe to run often. It targets the faucet's
*total* balance (not unlocked) so it won't overfund while recent top-ups are
still locking.

Because dev-net coins have no value, the simplest setup is to run the donation
wallet's `monero-wallet-rpc` on the faucet server too (bound to `127.0.0.1`, on
its own port) so both wallets are local. If you keep the donation wallet on a
separate machine, point `--faucet-rpc-url` through an SSH tunnel or VPN.

cron, every 15 minutes (one line per net). `flock` prevents overlapping runs if
one ever hangs past the interval:

```cron
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/cf-topup-stagenet.lock python3 /path/to/tools/fund_faucet.py --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:38083/json_rpc --faucet-rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:38088/json_rpc --address <faucet stagenet address> --nettype stagenet --target 0.3 --yes >> /var/log/cypherfaucet-topup.log 2>&1
```

(`38083` = the donation wallet's RPC; `38088` = the faucet wallet's RPC. Add a
second line with the testnet ports/address and its own lock file for the testnet
faucet.)

Or a systemd timer:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/cypherfaucet-topup.service
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tools/fund_faucet.py --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:38083/json_rpc --faucet-rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:38088/json_rpc --address <faucet stagenet address> --nettype stagenet --target 0.3 --yes

# /etc/systemd/system/cypherfaucet-topup.timer
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:0/15
Persistent=true
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Enable with `systemctl enable --now cypherfaucet-topup.timer`. (systemd won't
start a second run while one is still active, so no lock file is needed here.)

The Litecoin faucet needs no equivalent: Bitcoin Core manages change outputs
itself, so just keep the wallet topped up with spendable tLTC.

## Adding another Bitcoin Core-family coin

[core-faucet.php](core-faucet.php) is coin-agnostic; Bitcoin testnet is already
stubbed in its `$COINS` map. To enable a coin:

1. Uncomment (or add) its entry in the `$COINS` map, setting the RPC port,
   payout, claim window, address hint, and explorer URL.
2. Add the matching pretty-URL rewrite in `.htaccess`
   (e.g. `^btc-testnet/?$ core-faucet.php?coin=btc`).
3. Add its payout table (e.g. `tbtc_payouts`) and IP index to
   [db/create_db.py](db/create_db.py), and the table name to
   [db/cleanup.php](db/cleanup.php).
4. Set `<coin>_rpc_user` / `<coin>_rpc_pass` (and optionally `donate_<coin>`)
   in `config.php`, and run the daemon (e.g. `bitcoind -testnet`).

## Security notes

- Keep `config.php` and the SQLite DB out of the repo and out of the web root.
- Bind `monero-wallet-rpc` to `127.0.0.1` (or use real `--rpc-login` creds). A
  reachable, unauthenticated wallet RPC can be drained directly.
- On SELinux systems (Fedora/RHEL), the DB directory needs the
  `httpd_sys_rw_content_t` context for Apache to write it.
- Rate limiting trusts `CF-Connecting-IP` (falling back to `REMOTE_ADDR`);
  `X-Forwarded-For` / `Client-IP` are ignored. For that header to be
  unspoofable, the origin must only be reachable through Cloudflare: firewall it
  to Cloudflare's IP ranges (https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) and/or enable
  Authenticated Origin Pulls. Otherwise a direct-to-origin request can forge it.

### Forking

If you run your own instance, change the operator-specific bits (they're
hardcoded, not in config): the domain in the `canonical` / `og:` / `twitter:`
meta and in `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt`, the footer attribution, the operator
and contact details in `legal.php`, and the PGP identity in `contact.php`,
`SECURITY.md`, and `tech1k.txt`. Secrets, RPC creds, and donation details
(address, OpenAlias, QR path) live in `config.php`; if you enable donations, add
your own QR image (the operator one is gitignored).

Issues and pull requests are welcome.
